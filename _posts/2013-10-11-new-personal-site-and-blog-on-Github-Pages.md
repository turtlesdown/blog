This is my new attempt at creating a personal website/blog that will (hopefully) not become as outdated as the previous one.

## New Host

Administering my previous blog on Linode was overkill. I've now switched to the comparatively easy solution of hosting my site on GitHub [Pages](http://pages.github.com/). The repository for this blog can be found [here](https://github.com/gunnaraasen/gunnaraasen.github.io).

## New Programming Language

For the last several months, I've been working on learning a new programming language called [Go](http://golang.org/) (or golang if you want to effectively google it). I've found golang to be fairly easy to pick up straightforward syntax and concise core library. However, it is still a relatively young language (the first stable long-term version Go 1 was just [released](http://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html) last year). It's newness tends to show in the number of different libraries available and the size of the community compared to other popular languages like ruby or python. Judging from the activity on the [golang-nuts](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/golang-nuts) mailing list, I am confident those aspects will improve over time.

## Static Site

I spent some time playing around with a few static site generators in Go. I'm planning to write a separate post to review them.
